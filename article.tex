\begin{abstract}
The goal of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is to investigate the brain's functional connections by using the temporal similarity between blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals in different regions of the brain “at rest” as an indicator of synchronous neural activity.
However having different images of patients' brains despite the sequential time based information, may contain enough data to investigate their brains and enables us to recognize some diseases.
In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically extract these non time sequence based information using a Bayesian deep learning algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN).
Instead of using some predefined points of interest (POIs) we use the whole data in training phase so those points of the brain which do not contain related information about the disease will be ignored automatically by the trained model.
Moreover this method does not take any assumptions about disease, patients, etc.,
makes it a possible universal disease diagnosis approach to differentiate diseases having an impact on brain functionality.
This method is a supervised algorithm with small amount of calculations using three dimensional CNN.
Each fMRI scan (which contains {\it t} time slices of brain) of patients will divided into {\it t} different 3D images enabling us to make our dataset much bigger in number and calculations way simpler.
Subsequently all of these image are fed to a Bayesian network similar to LeNet-5 (but in three dimensions) to train our model.
Then to determine if a person is suffering from Parkinson's or not, we test his/her {\it t} fMRI images and get {\it t} different results which leads to a fraction (probability) of how unhealthy his/her brain is and if that fraction is above 0.5 we can classify that sample as a Parkinson's patient.

\section{Introduction}

The Elsevier cas-dc class is based on the
standard article class and supports almost all of the functionality of
that class. In addition, it features commands and options to format the
\begin{itemize} \item document style \item baselineskip \item front
matter \item keywords and MSC codes \item theorems, definitions and
proofs \item lables of enumerations \item citation style and labeling.
\end{itemize}

This class depends on the following packages
for its proper functioning:

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep=0pt
\item {natbib.sty} for citation processing;
\item {geometry.sty} for margin settings;
\item {fleqn.clo} for left aligned equations;
\item {graphicx.sty} for graphics inclusion;
\item {hyperref.sty} optional packages if hyperlinking is
  required in the document;
\end{enumerate}  

All the above packages are part of any
standard \LaTeX{} installation.
Therefore, the users need not be
bothered about downloading any extra packages.

\section{Installation}

The package is available at author resources page at Elsevier
(\url{http://www.elsevier.com/locate/latex}).
The class may be moved or copied to a place, usually,\linebreak
\verb+$TEXMF/tex/latex/elsevier/+, %$%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
or a folder which will be read                   
by \LaTeX{} during document compilation.  The \TeX{} file
database needs updation after moving/copying class file.  Usually,
we use commands like \verb+mktexlsr+ or \verb+texhash+ depending
upon the distribution and operating system.

\section{Front matter}

The author names and affiliations could be formatted in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item Group the authors per affiliation.
\item Use footnotes to indicate the affiliations.
\end{enumerate}
See the front matter of this document for examples. 
You are recommended to conform your choice to the journal you 
are submitting to.

\section{Bibliography styles}

There are various bibliography styles available. You can select the
style of your choice in the preamble of this document. These styles are
Elsevier styles based on standard styles like Harvard and Vancouver.
Please use Bib\TeX\ to generate your bibliography and include DOIs
whenever available.

Here are two sample references: 
\cite{Calhoun2016}
\cite{Phan2002,Murphy2013}
\cite{Sarraf2016,Lecun1995,Calhoun2004,Gal2016,UsaToday,OpenFmri,Handwerker2012}

\section{Floats}
{Figures} may be included using the command,\linebreak 
\verb+\includegraphics+ in
combination with or without its several options to further control
graphic. \verb+\includegraphics+ is provided by {graphic[s,x].sty}
which is part of any standard \LaTeX{} distribution.
{graphicx.sty} is loaded by default. \LaTeX{} accepts figures in
the postscript format while pdf\LaTeX{} accepts {*.pdf},
{*.mps} (metapost), {*.jpg} and {*.png} formats. 
pdf\LaTeX{} does not accept graphic files in the postscript format. 



The \verb+table+ environment is handy for marking up tabular
material. If users want to use {multirow.sty},
{array.sty}, etc., to fine control/enhance the tables, they
are welcome to load any package of their choice and
{cas-dc.cls} will work in combination with all loaded
packages.

\begin{table}[width=.9\linewidth,cols=4,pos=h]
\caption{This is a test caption. This is a test caption. This is a test
caption. This is a test caption.}\label{tbl1}
\begin{tabular*}{\tblwidth}{@{} LLLL@{} }
\toprule
Col 1 & Col 2 & Col 3 & Col4\\
\midrule
12345 & 12345 & 123 & 12345 \\
12345 & 12345 & 123 & 12345 \\
12345 & 12345 & 123 & 12345 \\
12345 & 12345 & 123 & 12345 \\
12345 & 12345 & 123 & 12345 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}
\end{table}

\section[Theorem and ...]{Theorem and theorem like environments}

{cas-dc.cls} provides a few shortcuts to format theorems and
theorem-like environments with ease. In all commands the options that
are used with the \verb+\newtheorem+ command will work exactly in the same
manner. {cas-dc.cls} provides three commands to format theorem or
theorem-like environments: 

\begin{verbatim}
 \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
 \newtheorem{lemma}[theorem]{Lemma}
 \newdefinition{rmk}{Remark}
 \newproof{pf}{Proof}
 \newproof{pot}{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm2}}
\end{verbatim}


The \verb+\newtheorem+ command formats a
theorem in \LaTeX's default style with italicized font, bold font
for theorem heading and theorem number at the right hand side of the
theorem heading.  It also optionally accepts an argument which
will be printed as an extra heading in parentheses. 

\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{theorem} 
   For system (8), consensus can be achieved with 
   $\|T_{\omega z}$ ...
     \begin{eqnarray}\label{10}
     ....
     \end{eqnarray}
  \end{theorem}
\end{verbatim}  


\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}

\begin{theorem}
For system (8), consensus can be achieved with 
$\|T_{\omega z}$ ...
\begin{eqnarray}\label{10}
....
\end{eqnarray}
\end{theorem}

The \verb+\newdefinition+ command is the same in
all respects as its \verb+\newtheorem+ counterpart except that
the font shape is roman instead of italic.  Both
\verb+\newdefinition+ and \verb+\newtheorem+ commands
automatically define counters for the environments defined.

The \verb+\newproof+ command defines proof environments with
upright font shape.  No counters are defined. 


\section[Enumerated ...]{Enumerated and Itemized Lists}
{cas-dc.cls} provides an extended list processing macros
which makes the usage a bit more user friendly than the default
\LaTeX{} list macros.   With an optional argument to the
\verb+\begin{enumerate}+ command, you can change the list counter
type and its attributes.

\begin{verbatim}
 \begin{enumerate}[1.]
 \item The enumerate environment starts with an optional
   argument `1.', so that the item counter will be suffixed
   by a period.
 \item You can use `a)' for alphabetical counter and '(i)' 
  for roman counter.
  \begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item Another level of list with alphabetical counter.
    \item One more item before we start another.
    \item One more item before we start another.
    \item One more item before we start another.
    \item One more item before we start another.
\end{verbatim}

Further, the enhanced list environment allows one to prefix a
string like `step' to all the item numbers.  

\begin{verbatim}
 \begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
  \item This is the first step of the example list.
  \item Obviously this is the second step.
  \item The final step to wind up this example.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Cross-references}
In electronic publications, articles may be internally
hyperlinked. Hyperlinks are generated from proper
cross-references in the article.  For example, the words
\textcolor{black!80}{Fig.~1} will never be more than simple text,
whereas the proper cross-reference \verb+\ref{tiger}+ may be
turned into a hyperlink to the figure itself:
\textcolor{blue}{Fig.~1}.  In the same way,
the words \textcolor{blue}{Ref.~[1]} will fail to turn into a
hyperlink; the proper cross-reference is \verb+\cite{Knuth96}+.
Cross-referencing is possible in \LaTeX{} for sections,
subsections, formulae, figures, tables, and literature
references.

\section{Bibliography}

Two bibliographic style files (\verb+*.bst+) are provided ---
{model1-num-names.bst} and {model2-names.bst} --- the first one can be
used for the numbered scheme. This can also be used for the numbered
with new options of {natbib.sty}. The second one is for the author year
scheme. When  you use model2-names.bst, the citation commands will be
like \verb+\citep+,  \verb+\citet+, \verb+\citealt+ etc. However when
you use model1-num-names.bst, you may use only \verb+\cite+ command.

\verb+thebibliography+ environment.  Each reference is a\linebreak
\verb+\bibitem+ and each \verb+\bibitem+ is identified by a label,
by which it can be cited in the text:

\noindent In connection with cross-referencing and
possible future hyperlinking it is not a good idea to collect
more that one literature item in one \verb+\bibitem+.  The
so-called Harvard or author-year style of referencing is enabled
by the \LaTeX{} package {natbib}. With this package the
literature can be cited as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[\textbullet]
\item Parenthetical: \verb+\citep{WB96}+ produces (Wettig \& Brown, 1996).
\item Textual: \verb+\citet{ESG96}+ produces Elson et al. (1996).
\item An affix and part of a reference:\break
\verb+\citep[e.g.][Ch. 2]{Gea97}+ produces (e.g. Governato et
al., 1997, Ch. 2).
\end{enumerate}

In the numbered scheme of citation, \verb+\cite{<label>}+ is used,
since \verb+\citep+ or \verb+\citet+ has no relevance in the numbered
scheme.  {natbib} package is loaded by {cas-dc} with
\verb+numbers+ as default option.  You can change this to author-year
or harvard scheme by adding option \verb+authoryear+ in the class
loading command.  If you want to use more options of the {natbib}
package, you can do so with the \verb+\biboptions+ command.  For
details of various options of the {natbib} package, please take a
look at the {natbib} documentation, which is part of any standard
\LaTeX{} installation.

\appendix
\section{My Appendix}
Appendix sections are coded under \verb+\appendix+.

\verb+\printcredits+ command is used after appendix sections to list 
author credit taxonomy contribution roles tagged using \verb+\credit+ 
in frontmatter.
